Elasticache - in memory caching
 EC is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

    ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
* Memcached
* Redis
