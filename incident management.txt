Incident management is typically closely aligned with the service desk, which is the single point of contact for all users communicating with IT. When a service is disrupted or fails to deliver the promised performance during normal service hours, it is essential to restore the service to normal operation as quickly as possible. Also any condition that has the potential to result in a breach or degradation of service ought to trigger a response that prevents the actual disruption from occurring. These are the objectives of incident management.

Service desk personnel usually are identified as level 1 support, which includes the following activities:

Incident identification
Incident logging
Incident categorization
Incident prioritization
Initial diagnosis
Escalation, as necessary, to level 2 support
Incident resolution
Incident closure
Communication with the user community throughout the life of the incident
